            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Effective Date: January 24, 2026</p>
            <br>
            <p>At flee flame, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any sensitive information. This policy applies to our mobile applications, including our EMDR tools.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Health Data Privacy</h2>
            <p><strong>We prioritize your privacy.</strong> Our apps are designed to process data locally on your device whenever possible. We do not store, share, or sell your personal health data or session history to third parties.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Collection</h2>
            <p>We do not collect personal identification information unless you explicitly provide it (e.g., contacting us for support). We may collect anonymous, non-personal data such as device type, crash logs, and aggregate usage statistics to improve app stability and performance.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Use of Information</h2>
            <p>Any technical information collected is used solely for debugging, providing, and improving our services. Support communications are kept confidential and used only to resolve your inquiries.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our apps may use trusted third-party services for essential functions (e.g., app store analytics or crash reporting). These services are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>Please also visit our <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> section establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of our apps.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our <a href="support.html">support page</a>.</p>
