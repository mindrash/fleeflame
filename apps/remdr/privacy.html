            <h1>Privacy Policy - rEMDR</h1>
            <p>Effective Date: February 16, 2026</p>
            <br>
            <p>At flee flame, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes how rEMDR ("the App") collects, uses, and protects your data. rEMDR is a bilateral stimulation tool designed to support EMDR therapy practices, and it is built with privacy-first principles.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>rEMDR is designed with privacy at its core. The App stores data locally on your device and does not collect or transmit personal information to external servers.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
            <p>The following information is stored exclusively on your device using secure local storage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Session Preferences:</strong> Your selected duration, speed, pattern, and configuration for each session type (Eye Movement, Audio, Haptic, Breath, Color Flow, Body Scan)</li>
                <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences including theme choices, display options, and session configurations</li>
                <li><strong>Session History:</strong> Distress ratings (SUD scores) and session records stored locally for your personal tracking</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> This data is stored ONLY on your device. It is NOT transmitted to any server, cloud service, or third party.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>No Account Required</h3>
            <p>rEMDR does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personally identifiable information. The App functions entirely without login or registration.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Health Data Privacy</h2>
            <p><strong>We take health-related data seriously.</strong> While rEMDR is a bilateral stimulation tool and not a medical device, we recognize that users may use it in therapeutic contexts. We do not store, share, or sell your personal health data, session history, or distress ratings to third parties. All such information remains on your device under your control.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>All data collected by the App is used solely to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember your session settings between app uses</li>
                <li>Provide customized session configurations</li>
                <li>Track your distress ratings and session history for your personal review</li>
                <li>Improve your user experience within the App</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>rEMDR offers optional premium subscriptions that provide access to unlimited sessions and additional features. Subscriptions are processed through the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Subscription Management with RevenueCat</h3>
            <p>We use RevenueCat, a third-party subscription management service, to manage premium subscriptions. When you subscribe to premium features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anonymous User ID:</strong> RevenueCat generates an anonymous user ID to track your subscription status. This ID is not linked to your personal identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Purchase Data:</strong> Information about your subscription (such as purchase date, expiration date, and product identifier) is securely processed by RevenueCat.</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Processing:</strong> All payment processing is handled by Apple or Google through their respective payment systems. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or billing addresses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>RevenueCat operates in accordance with their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. The data they collect is limited to what's necessary to manage your subscription and verify your premium access.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Subscription Information</h3>
            <p>Subscriptions can be cancelled anytime through your App Store or Google Play account settings. You can restore previous purchases on new devices using the "Restore Purchases" option in the App.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not sell your data to third parties.</strong> Your session data, distress ratings, and preferences never leave your device except as described below.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For subscription management and premium access verification. Only subscription-related data (anonymous user ID and purchase transactions) is shared with RevenueCat.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentry:</strong> For crash reporting and error tracking in production. If enabled, Sentry may collect anonymous technical data such as device type, operating system version, and crash logs to help us identify and fix issues. No personal information or session data is sent to Sentry.</li>
                <li><strong>App Store Analytics:</strong> Basic installation and crash reporting data may be collected by Apple App Store or Google Play Store according to their respective privacy policies. This data is anonymized and aggregated.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored securely on your device using industry-standard local storage mechanisms provided by iOS and Android operating systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Cloud Sync:</strong> Your data is not synced to iCloud, our servers, or any cloud service</li>
                <li><strong>No Network Transmission:</strong> No session data or distress ratings leave your device</li>
                <li><strong>Offline-First:</strong> The App functions entirely offline and requires no internet connection for core features</li>
                <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> Data is stored in your device's sandbox environment, protected by your device's encryption and access controls</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>rEMDR is not directed to children under 13. However, since all data is stored locally on the device and no accounts are required, children can use the app safely under parental supervision. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
            <p>Parents and guardians should monitor their children's device usage and app permissions according to their family's privacy preferences.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>All data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. You have complete control:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delete App and Data:</strong> Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data</li>
                <li><strong>Clear App Data:</strong> Use your device's storage settings to clear app data while keeping the App installed</li>
                <li><strong>Reset Within App:</strong> Use the App's settings to reset preferences and session history</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have no servers storing your personal data, so data retention is entirely under your control.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access all your data through the App's settings and session history</li>
                <li>Modify your preferences at any time</li>
                <li>Delete all data by uninstalling the App or resetting within the App</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>International Users</h2>
            <p>rEMDR is available globally. Because we collect no personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GDPR (EU):</strong> Fully compliant — no personal data processing requiring consent</li>
                <li><strong>CCPA (California):</strong> Fully compliant — no personal information collected or sold</li>
                <li><strong>Other Privacy Laws:</strong> The App's privacy-by-design approach ensures broad compliance</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
