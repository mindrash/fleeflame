            <h1>Terms and Conditions - rEMDR</h1>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 16, 2026</p>
            <br>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the "rEMDR" application ("the App") provided by flee flame, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>1. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT: This application is for educational and self-help purposes only. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</strong></p>
            <p>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapy treatment that should ideally be administered by a certified professional. rEMDR provides bilateral stimulation tools, which are one component of clinical EMDR therapy. It does not replace the full 8-phase EMDR protocol. Using this App does not constitute a doctor-patient or therapist-client relationship.</p>
            <p>If you have a history of seizures, severe mental health conditions, or are experiencing a medical emergency, consult a healthcare professional before use. <strong>If you are in crisis, please call your local emergency services immediately.</strong></p>
            <br>

            <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
